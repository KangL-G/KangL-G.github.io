I received my M.S. degree from the School of Information Engineering, Jingdezhen Ceramics University, Jiangxi, China, in 2022. I am pursuing a Ph.D. with the School of Computer Science at South China Normal University, Guangzhou, China. My research interests include knowledge distillation, graph representation learning, and efficient networks that can be used on resource-constrained edge computing devices.
